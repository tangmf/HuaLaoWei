# üì¶ Database Schema for SmartCity Forum and Analytics Platform

This folder contains SQL schema definitions for all structured databases used in the SmartCity Forum and Municipal Analytics Platform. The project will eventually be deployed on Huawei Cloud, with GaussDB for structured data and OBS (Object Storage Service) for unstructured media files.

## üß† Schema Design Philosophy

- **Modular**: Data is broken into logical tables for maintainability and clarity.
- **Scalable**: Tables are designed to support millions of rows with proper indexing (to be added at deployment).
- **Flexible**: JSONB and GEOGRAPHY types are used to support rich metadata and spatial analysis.
- **Cloud-Ready**: Media files are not stored in the database but linked to Huawei OBS cloud paths.

## üß± Entity Relationships (Simplified)


## üîó Integration Notes

- **Post Visibility**: Only issues marked as `is_public = TRUE` appear in `forum_posts`.
- **Comments**: Comments support recursive replies via `parent_comment_id`.
- **Votes**: Voting is binary (like or dislike) and unique per user per post/comment.
- **Location Fields**: Use Huawei GaussDB PostGIS support (or `lat/lng` fallback).
- **Media Files**: Actual files (e.g., images/videos) are stored on OBS; `media_assets` only stores metadata and file paths.

## üõ† Deployment Plan

Once access to Huawei Cloud is granted:

1. Deploy all tables to **GaussDB**.
2. Configure spatial indexing for `GEOGRAPHY` fields (if supported).
3. Use **OBS buckets** for file uploads; store file URLs in `media_assets`.
4. Use **ModelArts** or custom pipelines for analysis using `analytics_*` tables.
