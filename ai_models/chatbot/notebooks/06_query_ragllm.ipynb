    "### Purpose of This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook brings together all the previous components to form a complete **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot pipeline**. \\\n",
    "It demonstrates how to take a user query, retrieve relevant information from a vector database, optionally rerank, and generate a final grounded response using a LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final stage of the RAG pipeline where we would want to see our municipal chatbot becomes fully functional for deployment use — \\\n",
    "capable of generating **context-aware**, **domain-specific** responses by combining LLM generation with trusted municipal documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Notebook Covers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accepting a user query as input\n",
    "- Retrieving relevant document chunks from the indexed vector database (Chroma)\n",
    "- Applying **Flashrank reranking** to improve relevance of results\n",
    "- Injecting the top-ranked context into a prompt template\n",
    "- Querying a **local or API-based LLM** (e.g., via Ollama or OpenAI)\n",
    "- Generating a final, human-readable response grounded in retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional LLMs often hallucinate or make up facts — especially in niche domains like municipal services. \\\n",
    "By grounding the LLM's response in documents retrieved from a trusted knowledge base, RAG improves both **accuracy** and **trustworthiness**. \\\n",
    "It ensures the chatbot answers queries with **real information**, not just guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions & Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes you have already:\n",
    "- Indexed your documents in a vector store (Chroma)\n",
    "- Set up an embedding model and reranker (e.g., SentenceTransformer + Flashrank)\n",
    "- Integrated and tested your LLM (via LangChain, Ollama, or OpenAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this notebook is a working pipeline that can be wrapped into an API, chatbot interface, or web app.\n"

      "Reasoning (optional): Okay, so I need to figure out if there have been any recent high-severity rodent issues in Toa Payoh based on the data provided. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I see that the user has shared several incidents reported between April 12 and April 15, all under different categories but all related to Toa Payoh Central area with coordinates (1.3321, 103.8478). \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each incident:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The first entry from April 15 mentions rodent issues in the context of \"Foreign gun every field treatment.\" I'm not entirely sure what that means, but it might refer to something like rat traps or efforts to control rats.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. There's another incident on April 13 related to high severity pests, specifically rodents in a food establishment. This one is more directly about rats or mice in a place where food is handled, which could be a health concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are other entries from April 12 about different issues like magazine security, bicycles, drains, and abandoned trolleys, but only the second entry on April 13 specifically mentions rodents in a food establishment. The rest don't mention rodents at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the user is asking about rodent issues, I should focus on that. Only one incident out of five is directly related to rodents, reported on April 13. It's categorized under Pests > Rodents in Food Establishment with high severity and status closed by NEA.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't see any other incidents from Toa Payoh Central after April 15, so I can conclude that there was a recent high-severity rodent issue in late April.\n"
