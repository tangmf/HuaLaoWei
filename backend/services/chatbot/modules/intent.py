                - Asking about current road conditions, construction, or blockages

                - General inquiries about what kinds of issues different agencies and town councils handle

                You DO NOT answer personal, emotional, nonsensical, or unrelated questions (e.g., about relationships, food, celebrities, hobbies, or general opinions). 
                For those, respond with "NO".

                Only respond with one word: YES or NO.

                Question: How do I report a noise complaint?

                Answer: DATA_DRIVEN_QUERY

                Query: What does LTA do?
